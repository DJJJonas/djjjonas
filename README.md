<p align="justify">I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on WEB development, TypeScript, and frameworks. I enjoy building well-structured, scalable applications and working with cutting-edge technologies. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and experiment with new tools and methodologies. I do not have or use social media platforms. I find that social media often creates unnecessary distractions. By focusing on what truly matters to me, I can dedicate more time and energy to my work and personal growth.</p>
